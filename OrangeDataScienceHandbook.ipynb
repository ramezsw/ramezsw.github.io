However, the general mindset in the data team shall revolve around delivering value to customers. Customer centricity is the key driver for digital transformation, and having proper data governance and analytics standards is key enabler of digital within Orange. Hence, by being focused on delivering value and better services to Orange customers, then by default the stakeholders, company, and the team will have increased value as well; A loyal customer adds value to the brand image, and in turn increase revenue and reduce retention costs which leads to happier management. Happier management will reflect onto the team where the team's value to the company and it's recognition will increase. So in the end, by focusing on customers, all the involved parties will gain value as well."

Machine learning and deep learning are terms that have existed since the 1950's, they are the hype and trend now due to the ever-increasing media attention. Data Science is much more than ML/DL — it is about problem solving, it is about data intuition and creativity, it is about finding unknown unknowns using endless different approaches and hypotheses.
